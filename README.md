# Introduction
This website was created for fans and players of the game genre MMO(Massively Multiplayer Online) to help them establish what certain terms mean inside the MMO world. The focus
of this website is to allow the users to Create, Edit and search for terms they come across in those games and to help them understand what they mean. MMO's have became increasingly popular as there are a huge variety of genres to play, as well as the game also being open world which gives the players choices of where they want to go and what they want to achieve.
